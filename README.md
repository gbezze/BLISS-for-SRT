# BLISS pipeline for SETI at the Sardinia Radio Telescope👽🏖️

![SRT dish](SRT.jpg)

This repository is the final product of my work at the SRT as part of the Breaktrough Listen 2025 summer internship, which consisted in:
1. Setting up a BLISS pipeline for the SRT computers.
2. Using it to analyze the observations made between the 28th of January and the 8th of July.
3. Evaluate how BLISS performs.

Everything is documented in this [report](./bliss_guide_SRT.md).
